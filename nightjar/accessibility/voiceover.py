"""VoiceOver output on the Mac — a Python port of ``VoiceOverOutput.cs``.

The C# version in the accessibility mod does three things, in order:

1. ``tell application "VoiceOver" to output "..."`` through ``NSAppleScript``
   — the lowest-latency path, and the one that interrupts cleanly;
2. ``NSAccessibilityPostNotificationWithUserInfo`` on the key window with
   ``NSAccessibilityAnnouncementRequestedNotification`` — the fallback for
   when the Apple Event to VoiceOver is not permitted (-1743, the value the
   C# checks for) because the process has never been granted automation;
3. an estimate of how long the utterance takes to speak, so callers have an
   ``is_speaking`` without VoiceOver itself having to report it.

This module is that, verbatim in shape, through pyobjc instead of raw
``objc_msgSend``: pyobjc *is* the msgSend plumbing the C# wrote by hand.
The C#'s ``dlopen`` of Foundation/AppKit and its ``objc_getClass`` /
``sel_registerName`` pairs all disappear — ``from AppKit import ...`` loads
the same frameworks and resolves the same classes.  What remains to port is
the order of attempts, the -1743 error number, the escaping, and the
priority-90 announcement dictionary.

``macOS 14+`` note: ``NSWorkspace.isVoiceOverEnabled`` is deprecated there in
favour of ``'voiceOverEnabled'`` in ``NSWorkspace.accessibilityDisplayShouldReduceMotion``'s
sibling dictionary; both are read here, the dictionary first.

The C# builds AppleScript sources with a cache of compiled scripts keyed by
text; speech text here is almost never repeated verbatim, so the cache bought
nothing and is not carried over — the C#'s ``Shutdown`` therefore has nothing
to release and is a no-op, kept for interface parity.
