"""The port's equivalent of Papa Engine's ``S3D`` audio layer.

The original built, per sound, a CSL graph of
``CASoundFile -> Butter low-pass -> gain Mixer -> FanOut -> {dry -> binaural
panner, wet -> Stereoverb} -> master Mixer``, with spatialised sounds routed
through ``csl::Spatializer(kBinaural)`` and a ``csl::DistanceSimulator``.
OpenAL Soft expresses the same graph with a source, a direct low-pass filter,
an auxiliary reverb send, and device-level HRTF rendering.

Constants recovered from The Nightjar's binary (engine 1_1_020, the same build
as Papa Sangre 1's):

===========================  ==========  ============================

Reverb
------
**One reverb for the whole game.**  ``-[PGEngine init]`` sets room size 2.1,
dampening 5 and volume 1 after ``-[S3DEngine init]``'s 1.5 / 50 / 1, and
nothing else ever writes them (no level property, no message).  The setters
clamp: room size to **[0.01, 2.3]** (``setReverbRoomSize:`` 0x1000d2638 /
0x1000d265c - the Papa Sangre 1 port reads this as [2.2, 2.3], which is
wrong), dampening to [0, 100], volume to [0, 8].  The only other path is
``disableReverb`` on old hardware, which has no meaning on a PC.

The original's reverb is CSL's Freeverb, recovered exactly in
``freeverb.py`` (six combs, three allpasses, feedback ``size * 0.28 + 0.3``,
the volume as its wet level).  OpenAL's EFX reverb is a different design, so
it is *fitted* to the recovered one rather than guessed:

* ``DECAY_TIME`` is the Freeverb's decay at 1 kHz and ``DECAY_HFRATIO`` its
  decay at 5 kHz over that, both from the comb loop gains
  (``freeverb.loop_decay``).  Freeverb's dampening shortens the treble *tail*;
  it does not filter what goes in, so ``GAINHF`` stays at 1.
* The loudness is the Freeverb's energy.  OpenAL Soft normalises its late
  reverb so its energy does not depend on the decay time (measured: within
  0.7 dB from 0.3 s to 3.5 s), so the gain is ``volume * sqrt(Freeverb
  energy)`` times one measured constant, ``EFX_ENERGY_MATCH``, which
  ``tools/measure_reverb.py`` fits and checks room by room.  Whatever EFX's
  ``GAIN`` (capped at 1) cannot carry goes into ``LATE_REVERB_GAIN``.
* No early reflections: Freeverb has none; its first echo is the shortest
  comb, 1116 samples (25 ms), which ``LATE_REVERB_DELAY`` reproduces.

Per sound, the original sends ``wetGain`` to the reverb and ``dryGain`` to the
output *after* the binaural panner (``-[S3DSound setupSpatialized]``:
spatializer -> gainControl -> FanOut -> dryMixer / wetMixer), and a positioned
sound re-mixes both from its distance on every move (``autoReverbMix``, see
``Sound._auto_mix``).  Because the split comes after the panner, the reverb
send falls off with distance exactly as the direct sound does.

Coordinate frames
-----------------
Level data is in Tiled pixels, centred on the room (see GAME_STRUCTURE.md §4).
``-[S3DEngine normalizeToHeadPosition:]`` turns a world point into a
listener-relative one::

    d     = source - headPosition
    a     = -headOrientation
    out.x = (d.x*cos(a) - d.y*sin(a)) * distanceScale
    out.y = (d.x*sin(a) + d.y*cos(a)) * distanceScale

with a guard that nudges a coincident source 5 cm aside.  CSL's Cartesian
convention (recovered from the HRTF direction loader, which builds
``x = cos(el)cos(az), y = sin(az)cos(el), z = sin(el)`` with IRCAM azimuth 90
being the left ear) is **+X forward, +Y left, +Z up**.

OpenAL uses **+X right, +Y up, -Z forward**, so the mapping is::

    al = (-csl.y, csl.z, -csl.x)

Because the engine does its own listener transform, every source is marked
``AL_SOURCE_RELATIVE`` and the OpenAL listener is left at the origin with the
identity orientation — exactly mirroring the original's structure.

        The original has two separate paths.  ``-[S3DSound setupSpatialized]``
        builds a binaural spatialiser; ``setupPlain`` builds an ordinary
        ``csl::Panner`` and mixes straight to the output.  Only the first is
        ever convolved with head-related filters.

        OpenAL Soft, with HRTF switched on, virtualises *everything* - a stereo
        source becomes a pair of virtual loudspeakers convolved with the HRIRs.
        Measured on the shipped assets, that collapsed the ambience from an
        inter-channel correlation of 0.011 to 0.879 (a wide stereo bed squashed
        almost to mono), flattened the deliberate 1.4 dB left/right lean that
        distinguishes the left and right footstep samples to 0.01 dB, cost about
        10 dB of level, and coloured everything with a head that is not yours.

        ``AL_DIRECT_CHANNELS_SOFT`` restores the original's split: an
        un-spatialised source is mixed to the output channels untouched, while
        3D sources still get the recovered HRTF.  ``AL_REMIX_UNMATCHED_SOFT`` is
        used rather than plain ``AL_TRUE`` so that a *mono* un-spatialised sound
        is spread across both channels instead of being dropped.
