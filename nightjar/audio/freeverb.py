"""The original's reverb, recovered exactly: CSL's ``Freeverb`` as Papa Engine
builds it.  A reference model, used to measure the port's reverb against.

Recovered first from Papa Sangre II's binary (engine 1_1_013, where the table
below was read); checked against The Nightjar's (1_1_020, a different compiler,
so the bodies are not byte-identical):

This is *not* Jezar's Freeverb as usually shipped.  Only the first **six** of
the eight comb tunings and the first **three** of the four allpass tunings are
used (the tables at 0x1001b8850 / 0x1001b8870 hold all of them; the loops stop
at 6 and 3), the room offset is 0.3 instead of 0.7, and there is no
``scalewet``: the level's ``reverbVolume`` is the wet gain itself.  The right
channel's Freeverb is built identically to the left's - no stereo spread.

Per sample, for one channel (``nextBuffer``)::

    in  = x * 0.015                                  fixedgain, +0xcc
    acc = 0
    for each comb (delay D, feedback f, damp1, damp2 = 1 - damp1):
        out   = buf[i]
        store = out * damp2 + store * damp1
        buf[i] = in + store * f
        acc  += out
    for each allpass (delay D, feedback 0.5):
        b      = buf[i]
        buf[i] = acc + b * 0.5
        acc    = b - acc
    y = acc * wet + x * dry                          vDSP_vsmul + vDSP_vsma

The engine starts it at room 2.2, dampening 2, wet 0, dry 0, then
``-[PGEngine init]`` sets 2.1 / 5 / 1 and each level's Room its own values.
The setters clamp as ``engine.py`` records.

The delays are in samples at the engine's rate, 44100 Hz (``0xac44``).
