"""The sound monitors - `-[S3DEngineDispatcher dispatch_pump]`.

The original fires its monitors from a pump that re-arms itself with
`dispatch_after(9,999,999 ns)`: every 10 ms, on the main thread.  A PGESound's
fade-in steps its gain once per fire (the step is computed for 10 ms), the end
music is started 0.2 s before a sound's end, and a non-looping sound's end is
reported through a main-queue block.

A monitor is `fn(position, duration) -> stop`; returning True removes it.  An
end callback (`add3DSoundEndCallback:`) runs each time a looping sound wraps.
A sound stopped on purpose (`stop`) reports no end: the original's skip and
deactivate paths fire their own triggers, and the data relies on the end
trigger not following a skip.
