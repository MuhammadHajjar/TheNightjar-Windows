"""The message bus - the port's ``NSNotificationCenter`` / ``NSNotificationQueue``.

Papa Engine is built entirely on broadcast messages.  A trigger does not look
up its target; it posts ``PGE_MESSAGE_ActivateAgentWithName`` with a ``name``
parameter, every agent in the level receives it, and each one decides for itself
whether the name matches.  That is why several triggers in the shipped data name
agents that do not exist and simply do nothing (GAME_STRUCTURE.md section 11) -
reproducing the broadcast reproduces those no-ops for free.

Three delivery paths, matching the original:

``post``
    Immediate, synchronous - ``postNotificationName:object:``.  Used by the
    engine itself (player moved, sound ended, state changed).

``enqueue``
    Deferred until the next drain - ``enqueueNotification:postingStyle:`` with
    ``NSPostWhenIdle`` (recovered: ``mov w3, #1`` before the call in
    ``-[PGEObjectWithTriggers triggerWithType:]``).  Every trigger statement
    without an ``afterDelay`` goes through here, so trigger effects land after
    the current update finishes rather than re-entering it.

``post_after``
    ``performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:`` - a trigger's ``afterDelay``.
    Cancellable by token, which the original relies on when it cancels a pending
    ``changeState:`` on every step.

Two more run-loop paths carry code rather than messages:

``dispatch_async``
    ``dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{...})`` - the block runs on
    the next pass of the run loop, **before** the idle notification queue
    (a main-queue block is a run-loop source; ``NSPostWhenIdle`` waits until
    the loop has nothing else to do).  PS2 uses it for agent activation and
    for sound-end callbacks.

``call_after``
    ``performSelector:withObject:afterDelay:`` / ``dispatch_after`` with a
    callable.  Cancellable by token like ``post_after``.

Note on coalescing: ``enqueueNotification:postingStyle:`` coalesces on name and
sender, but the sender here is a freshly built parameter dictionary each time,
so two enqueued messages are never identical objects and nothing is ever merged.
The port therefore delivers every enqueued message, in order.
