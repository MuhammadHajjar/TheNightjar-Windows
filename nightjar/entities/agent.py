"""``PGEGameAgent`` - the base for everything in a level that is not the floor.

Recovered defaults from ``-[PGEGameAgent init]``: ``collideRadius`` 20,
``speed`` 10, ``active`` NO.

Collision (``checkCollisionsWithPlayer``) is a plain squared-distance test
against ``collideRadius``, run every time the player moves, and it fires
``OnCollide`` **every frame the player is inside the radius** - there is no
"already triggered" latch.  In practice the shipped levels deactivate the
trigger from inside its own ``OnCollide``, which is why that does not matter;
the port keeps the original behaviour rather than adding a latch.

Every agent listens to the same broadcast messages the original subscribes to in
``init``, and each decides for itself whether a ``name`` parameter is its own.
