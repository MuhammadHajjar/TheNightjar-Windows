"""``PGEEnemy`` - the things in the dark.

``-[PGEEnemy update:]`` is a thirteen-way switch on ``state``, dispatched
through a jump table at 0x10001de50.  Decoding that table gives:

===  =========  ==================================================
 1   IDLE       play ``defaultSound`` on a loop, walk speed
 2   ALERT_PLAYER    one shot, becomes 3
 3   CHASE_PLAYER    ``chaseSpeed``, ``chaseSound``, head for the player,
                     remembering where it started
 4   ALERT_POSITION  one shot, becomes 5
 5   GO_TO_POSITION  ``chaseSpeed``, ``chaseSound``, head for ``wantedPosition``
 6   AT_POSITION     stopped getting closer; ``distractedTimer`` runs, optional
                     ``attackSound``, then goes home
 7   ATTACK          stop the current sound and play ``attackSound``
 8-11               unused - the jump table sends them straight to the tail
12   ALERT_AGENT     ``awareSound``, then becomes 5 after one second
13   RETURNING       ``defaultSound``, ``walkingSpeed``, walk back to where it
                     was before it was disturbed; on arrival becomes 1
===  =========  ==================================================

Each state does its entry work once, guarded by ``state_atPreviousFrame``, then
its continuous work every frame.

This is the Papa Sangre 1 port's reading, with the four changes chosen for it
carried over (BUILD_ORDER decision 1).  PGEEnemy is instruction-identical in
the two binaries, 0x10 later in this one; the addresses here are this
binary's (tools/ps1_addresses.py).

Note what is *not* here: nothing in ``update:`` looks at how close the player
is.  An enemy never notices you by itself; it has to be told, by
``AlertAllEnemies``, ``AlertEnemyWithName`` or ``AlertEnemiesWithinRadius`` -
in The Nightjar, by the hot water and guts you step in (levels 8, 9), a trip,
a sensor that wakes it (9) or its own ``OnLoad`` (12).
