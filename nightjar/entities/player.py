        Everything here is the original except the divisor, and the divisor is
        the whole reason the ice levels were unplayable.

        The original sums the gaps between the timestamps it is holding and then
        divides by the **number of timestamps** instead of the number of gaps
        (`ucvtf s0, x0` on `[walkTimes count]` at 0x100025d74, then
        `fdiv s0, s1, s0` at 0x100025d7c).  Five stamps span four gaps, so the
        answer comes out `count / (count - 1)` too high - and since the array
        fills from empty, *how* much too high depends on how many steps ago the
        history was last cleared:

        ====== ================ ==============================================
        stamps reading          ps1_19's ice, whose data says tripBPM 80
        ====== ================ ==============================================
        3      90 / interval    trips you above 53 real BPM - slower than 1.125s
        4      80 / interval    slower than 1.000s
        5      75 / interval    slower than 0.938s
        ====== ================ ==============================================

        So the authored number never meant what it says, and worse, the
        threshold moved. `resetBPM` runs when you cross onto ground with a
        different `tripBPM` **and again on every trip**, so going down put you
        straight back into the three-stamp window at its strictest: three free
        steps, then a fall, three free steps, then a fall. On a seven-step ice
        band that is not a difficulty spike, it is a level you cannot leave -
        reported as "every like 4 steps in the thin ice I trip, even if I walk
        very very slowly... like a softlock".

        Dividing by the gaps makes the reading exactly 60 / interval - your
        tempo, in beats per minute, whatever the history holds. Every authored
        cap then means what it says: the ice trips you above 80 real BPM
        (0.75s a step), ps1_11's quicksand above 65 (0.923s), the siren and the
        old man above 50 (1.2s). The reset stops changing the threshold and just
        gives you three steps' grace on new ground, and a rhythm that was safe
        stays safe - which is what both players remembered of the original.

        This is a change, not a recovery. See DIVERGENCES.md 4c.

          an **exact** name lookup.  ps1_2, ps1_3, ps1_11 and ps1_12 all name
          one on their surfaces, so this is the live path on those levels;
        * otherwise -> ``[playlist anySoundContaining:@"trip"]``, which collects
          every sound whose key contains "trip" and picks one with
          ``arc4random``.  On a level whose playlist carries two grounds' worth
          of trip sounds and names none of them - ps1_7 - that is a coin flip.

        ``footstepsPrefix ?: @"foot_racetrack"`` at 0x100027490 and then throws
        it away at 0x10002778c without ever reading it.  ``shuffle`` does the
        same thing and finishes with ``stringWithFormat:@"%@_shuffle"``; there
        is no ``@"%@_trip"`` in the binary.
