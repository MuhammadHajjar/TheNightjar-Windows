"""Game controller input, mapped onto the same actions as the keyboard.

The original was a touchscreen game with no controller support at all, so none
of this is recovered - it is a port-side addition, like the keyboard.  What it
does have to respect is the shape of the mechanic: walking is two *discrete
alternating presses*, not an axis, because the whole movement system is built
on the timing between them.  So the feet are the two triggers, read as presses
at a threshold, and nothing about walking is derived from how far a stick is
pushed.

Which button does what lives in :mod:`padmap` and is rebindable from the
options menu, exactly like the keyboard; the defaults are:

=====================  ==========================================
Left / right trigger   left foot / right foot
Left stick X           turn, proportional to how far it is pushed
D-pad up / down        menus: move
D-pad left / right     in play: volume down / up; menus: adjust
A                      select, and skip narration
B / Back               back
Start                  pause menu
=====================  ==========================================

**Button positions come from SDL's game controller database, not from raw
button numbers.**  That distinction is the whole reason this module is not
twenty lines long: raw joystick numbering is per-device and wildly
inconsistent.  On an Xbox pad button 0 is A and button 7 is Start; on a
DualShock 4 button 0 is Square and button 7 is R2.  Mapping raw numbers would
mean "A selects" silently became "Square selects, and R2 pauses" on a
PlayStation pad.  SDL knows the layout of several hundred controllers, so
``a`` here means *the bottom face button* - Cross on a PlayStation pad - and
``start`` means Options.

A pad SDL does not recognise falls back to raw joystick numbers, which is a
guess, but a guess that only applies to pads nobody has a mapping for.  The
left stick turns and is not rebindable: it is the only stick the game uses.
