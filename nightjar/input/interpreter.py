"""``PGEMoveInterpretor`` - turns raw input into the engine's action messages.

This is where the walking mechanic lives.  You do not hold a
direction; you place one foot, then the other, and the *timing* of that
alternation is the whole control scheme.  Everything below is recovered from
``-[PGEMoveInterpretor footButtonPressed:]`` and ``footButtonReleased:``.

The rules, exactly as the original has them:

* Nothing happens unless ``player_can_walk``.
* Nothing happens while the player state is 3 (tripped).
* A foot must be pressed and then **released** - the step fires on release.
  (The Windows port calls both on key-down instead, so the foot lands as you
  press it; nothing in this class changes for that - see DIVERGENCES §4c.)
* **A foot whose entry in ``feetViewDict`` is "off" is ignored entirely**, on
  both press and release.  This is the alternation rule, and it is the whole
  reason you cannot run by hammering one key: the foot you just used is put
  "off" and stays there.
* Otherwise the foot's timestamp is updated and ``PGE_ACTION_OneStep`` is posted
  carrying ``lastFoot``, which is what advances the player.

``updateFeetView:`` is what decides which feet are available, and it is called
after every step and again 0.1 s and 2.0 s later.  For each foot:

* if it is the foot you last used and you used it less than **2 seconds** ago,
  it is **"off"** - unavailable;
* otherwise it is **"on"**, and if it is the foot you last used and the gap has
  grown past 2 seconds (but is under 99), the engine posts ``PGE_ACTION_Shuffle``
  - the sound of you shifting your weight - and forgets which foot you used, so
  both feet are free again.

So: alternate and you walk; repeat a foot and nothing happens at all; stand
still for two seconds and you hear yourself shuffle and may start on either
foot.  The 1-second same-foot ``PGE_ACTION_Trip`` branch further down is real
code in the binary but is unreachable behind this gate - see ``trip_would_fire``.

The enable/disable flags (walk, rotate, jump, hands, swim) are driven by the
``PGE_MESSAGE_Enable*`` / ``Disable*`` messages that level triggers send - every
level's Room begins by disabling walking and rotation until its intro narration
finishes.
