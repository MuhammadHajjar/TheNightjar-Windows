"""Rebindable controller bindings - the pad's answer to :mod:`keymap`.

The original was a touchscreen game, so like the keyboard none of this is
recovered; what is shared with the keyboard is the *action* list, which is
recovered, so a pad button and a key that do the same thing are literally the
same action downstream.

The **triggers are in here too**, as ``lefttrigger`` and ``righttrigger``.
SDL reports them as axes rather than buttons, so nothing would ever have
offered them to bind; they are read each frame and turned into an ordinary
press and release, which is what lets someone put their feet on L2 and R2.

Buttons are named the way SDL's controller database names them - ``a``, ``b``,
``start``, ``dpleft`` - **not** by raw joystick number.  That matters: raw
numbering is per-device, so button 0 is A on an Xbox pad and Square on a
DualShock.  Binding by name means a binding made on one pad still means the
bottom face button on the other.

Bindings live in ``config/controller.json`` beside ``keys.json``.
