"""Keyboard input via SDL, mapped through the rebindable :class:`KeyMap`.

A window is needed only to receive key events; nothing is ever drawn in it.
Key **timing** is what the whole game runs on, so the loop polls at a high rate
and timestamps events from ``time.perf_counter`` on arrival - the same
granularity the original got from ``[NSDate date]`` inside its touch handler.
