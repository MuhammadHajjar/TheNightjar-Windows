"""``PGEGameProgress`` - what the game remembers between runs.

A singleton over ``NSUserDefaults`` in the original.  There is no
``NSUserDefaults`` here, so the port writes a JSON file next to the executable,
but it keeps the original's **key names**, including their oddities, so the
saved state is a faithful record of what the engine tracks:

===========================  ==================================================
``<level>_completed``        bool - the level has been finished
``<level>_locked``           bool - **true means unlocked.**  The key reads
                             backwards; ``isLevelUnlocked:`` returns the value
                             as-is, so the name is simply wrong in the original
``lastLevelUnlocked``        string - written **only the first time** a level is
                             unlocked, so it records how far you have got rather
                             than the last level you happened to unlock again
``lastPLaylist``             string - the playlist in use.  The capital L is the
                             original's typo and is kept: change it and a save
                             written by the original would not be read back
``<sound name>``             bool - this narration has been heard once and may
                             now be skipped
``<dilemma id>``             bool - the choice made at that dilemma
===========================  ==================================================

``lastUnlockedLevel`` falls back to the first level of whichever game is
running: ``nightJar_1`` for The Nightjar (``ps1_1`` for Papa Sangre, which
shares the engine).
