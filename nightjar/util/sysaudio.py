"""Audio settings, per platform, that can silently defeat binaural rendering.

Worth checking before anyone concludes the spatialisation is broken: if the
system is mixing everything to mono, or the output is a virtual cable, no HRTF
in the world will produce a direction.

The Windows checks read the registry; the Mac one reads the universal-access
default (see :mod:`.host`, which decides which applies).  The device-name
suspicion list is shared: a virtual cable defeats HRTF on every platform.
