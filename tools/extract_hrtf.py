"""Recover the original HRTF from the iOS binary and emit a makemhr data set.

Papa Engine embeds its default HRTF inside the executable and loads it through
an in-memory ``MemFile`` (log line: *"Using the builtin, embedded default HRTF
instead."*).  ``tools/embedded_hrtf.dat`` is that blob, lifted verbatim from
offset 0x100142c54 (length word at 0x1002bb188).

Layout, from ``MemFile``-based loader at 0x1000cad04:

    line 1            "HRTF <name>\\t<dirs>\\t<total>\\t<perEar>\\t<channels>"
    next <dirs> lines "<azimuth>\\t<elevation>"   (IRCAM LISTEN convention:
                                                   azimuth counter-clockwise)
    blank line
    per direction     4 blocks, each fread(size=8, count=perEar)
                      = 4 x 256 interleaved complex float32 (re, im)
                      order: A[0] B[0] A[1] B[1]
    trailer           "HRTF\\n"

Blocks A[1]/B[1] (the third and fourth) are the left- and right-ear transfer
functions.  The bins are stored **conjugated** relative to the usual DFT sign
convention: reading them as (re + i*im) gives the right magnitude response but
time-reverses the impulse, which shows up as an interaural delay of the correct
size and the wrong sign.  Reading them as (re - i*im) yields causal impulse
responses whose ITD and ILD agree and match a real head (see ``validate``).
Blocks A[0]/B[0] are a second, much lower-energy pair whose purpose is not yet
established; they are not used.

Outputs (under ``build/hrtf/``):
    wav/az###_el###.wav   one stereo WAV per direction (left ear, right ear)
    papa_ircam_1050.def   makemhr definition file
Then run makemhr to produce the .mhr that OpenAL Soft loads.
